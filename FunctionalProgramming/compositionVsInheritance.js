//inheritance

//tight coupling issue
// coupling between child and parent class is tight form
// can break child methods because parent class is slightly changed

//fragile baseclass issue


//hierarchy problem

//how composition fixes these issues
//changes a class from what it is to what it does


//inheritance is a super class that extends to children classes that can overwrite or extend the super class

// composition is smaller pieces to make desired output which makes it easy to add or remove pieces
