# Advanced-JS-concepts
# FP and OOP


# FP 
# - Many operations on fixed data
# - stateless
# - pure functions wihtout side effects
# - declarative
# - 



# OOP 
# - Few operations on common data
# - stateful
# - side effects/ methods manipulating internal state
# - imperative/ how we want it done

# when to use FP or OOP

# FP is good for processing large data applications
# or for when you have a few things that require many functions

# OOP is good for when you only need a few functions
